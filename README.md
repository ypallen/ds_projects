This repository is for a list of projects I did for the Data Science and Business Analytics certification.

All data is publicly available on Kaggle.

***********************************
Car Analysis:

The market has a huge demand for used cars. Sales of new cars have recently decreased, and the pre-owned car market has increased to exceed the new car market.  
This means a shift in demand towards the pre-owned market, therefore the pricing scheme of these used cars increases in importance when growing in the market. 
Sellers should not sell below the market price.

Machine Learning is used to develop a pricing model that effectively predicts the price of used cars and can help the seller in devising profitable strategies using differential pricing.

The dependent variable is the Price

***********************************
Loan Modelling

The bank wants to rapidly expand their Customer base to bring in more loan business and therefore earn more through the interest on loans.
They have requested an exploration of converting its Liability Customers to Personal Loan Customers while retaining them as depositors.

Machine Learning is used to develop a customer conversion model that effectively predicts the usage of personal loans and can help marketing to existing customers.

The dependent variable is Personal Loan

Credit Card Analysis

The bank would like to market to new and existing customers to improve its services. Data from existing customers can be analyzed to identify customer preference for interaction.

Machine Learning is used to develop customer segmentation model that predicts an optimal contact method and focus on areas for improvement.
