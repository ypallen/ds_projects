Car Analysis:

The market has a huge demand for used cars. Sales of new cars have recently decreased, and the pre-owned car market has increased to exceed the new car market.  
This means a shift in demand towards the pre-owned market, therefore the pricing scheme of these used cars increases in importance when growing in the market. 
Sellers should not sell below the market price.

Machine Learning will be used to develop a pricing model that effectively predicts the price of used cars and can help the seller in devising profitable strategies using differential pricing.

The dependent variable is the Price
